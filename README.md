ASSIGNMENT 2:
Module 3: Control Structures in Python
 
Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.
2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. 	Displays the result accordingly.
Expected Output:
The program should return an output like:

Enter a number 5
The number 5 is an Odd number
Enter a number 4
The number 4 is an Even number


Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3.   Displays the final sum.
 
Expected Output:
The program should return:
 
 The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is 1275

 



ASSIGNMENT 3:
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.
 
Expected Output:
For example, if the function is called with 5, it should return:

Enter a number 5
The factorial of 5 is 120

Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Asks the user for a number as input.
2.   Uses the math module to calculate the:
o   Square root of the number
o   Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
o   Sine of the number (in radians)
3.   Displays the calculated results.
 Expected Output:
For example, if the user enters 25, the output should be:

Enter a number25
Square root of the number  25 is 5.0
Logarithmic vaue  of the number 25 is 3.2188758248682006
Square root of the number 25 is -0.13235175009777303

ASSIGNMENT 4:
 
Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors 
Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1.   Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
2.   Prints its content line by line.
3.   Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.
 
Expected Output:

If the file exists:


If the file does not exist:

Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
2.   Appends additional data to the same file.
3.   Reads and displays the final content of the file.
 

Expected Output:
For example, if the user enters 'This is first line in the file', the output should be:


Enter some data to write to the file: This is first line in the file

Final content of the file:
This is first line in the file
This is additional data appended to the file.

ASSIGNMENT 5:
Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python
 
Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
2.   Asks the user to input a student's name.
3.   Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
4.   If the student’s name is not found, display an appropriate message.

Expected Output:
  
 
If the student does not exist in the dictionary:
 
Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
2.   Extracts the first five elements from the list.
3.   Reverses these extracted elements.
4.   Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list
 
Expected Output:
